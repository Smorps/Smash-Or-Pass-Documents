# Patch Notes
Lots of embed related updates~ Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
* Updated embeds related to top.gg votes/patreon subs/server passes/use limits to use random gifs instead of just one gif (it's more fun this way!)
* Updated the frequency at which the above embeds send and ensured all are ephemeral
* Top.gg vote locks will now send after a user's 3rd interaction instead of their 2nd, and calls for buying a server pass will send with each 6th poll
* Added links to the bot store for server passes in embed messages for instances in which Discord doesn't properly load the server pass buttons
* Updated the server pass related embed to use the bot's logo instead of its pfp
* Removed the message content in random polls that called out who created it as it conflicted with vote anonymity
