# SMORPS Release: Lady Grey - Birthday Update 🎊
January 25, 2025

Hi, everyone! 🎂 **It's Smash or Pass's 3rd birthday**!!! 🎂 Thank you so much for helping the bot grow to what it is today 🙏❤️ To celebrate, _you're_ getting **presents**! 😲 
Let's take a look at what we've got for you in this one 🎁

## 🥵🔥 Spicier random pictures 🔥🥵
Ok, hear me out - this is a great feature. Why? Because if you like random polls 🎲, and most of you do, you probably like anime and video game characters. 
So you'll probably also like seeing those characters in their most attractive angles too 😍 The images are still sourced from Danbooru, but to make this work, each one had to be handpicked 👩‍🌾🧺 
to ensure we hit that perfect balance of _hot_ 🌶️ but not _too hot_ 🌋 _Remember - Smash or Pass is for good boys and girls_ 👼

Right now we have about **500 characters** ready to grace ✨ your eyes 👁️👁️ with this feature, and _more_ are on the way 🛬 So you should really check this one out. 
To access our premium crop of pics, simply toggle the Danbooru maturity setting under ⚙️OPTIONS to 'sensitive'. You're also going to need ⭐**premium access**⭐, 
so hop on over to the [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/smashorpass) 
or give a gift of your own by buying a [server pass](https://discord.com/discovery/applications/912882119276109844/store) for you and the homies 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

## 🤮👽 26 New prompts 👽🤮
Speaking of things y'all like, the numbers say you're into some _really_ weird stuff - like weird butthole jokes and things like that 🤨 **So I whipped up some more for you!** 🧑‍🍳🍳 
That brings our total number of prompts up to a whopping **150**!! If I ever figure out how to put this bot on my resume, I'll be the CEO of a Fortune 500 in no time 😎

## 🤖🛸 Auto-Random Poll 🛸🤖
Another name for this could be "fast random poll" - basically whenever a random poll is first voted on 💥**BAM**💥 you get another one just like that. 
No going back to the smash menu, no re-hitting the "🎲RANDOM" button - just vote and we'll do the rest 😘 It's so much faster this way 🚀 Plus, you don't need to ask yourself, "Do I want to play again?" 
because I've made that decision for you, and the answer is _always_ YES! 🌈

## 🎨🧑‍🎨 Design Changes 🧑‍🎨🎨
Honestly, you'll see these for yourself, but let me tell you about it anyway 🤷 **Polls** got a little bit of makeover so they're less wordy and more clean 🧼 
Also, the **premium links** on the smash menu have been grouped together under one button 🔘 instead of three. 

## 🩷💗 Onto Year 4 💗🩷
Thank you again - whether you're just finding the bot or have been around since the beginning 🙇‍♂️ I'm still amazed by how much this has grown and continues to grow every year. 
I sincerely hope you enjoy these updates, and please let me know if you run into any issues or have any feedback in our 🚧support channel on
