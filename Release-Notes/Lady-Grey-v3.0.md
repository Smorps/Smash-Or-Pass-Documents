# SMORPS Release: Lady Grey - Valentine's Day Update 💝
February 14, 2025

Hello, everyone! ❤️ **Happy Valentine's Day!** Whether you're smashin' or passin', I hope you'll accept this update as my 
Valentine's Day present to you 💝😽 I wrapped it myself!

## 💌 New love letter UX! 💌
Sending love letters is now done through a slash command ✨ By moving this to a slash command, users may now specify who they want to send their love letters to 
instead of it being tied to a poll! Premium users may also add a pen name to their letters for an extra, personal touch 🖊️💋 Otherwise, love letters will still 
be sent anonymously 🥸 Also, you may now send multiple love letters to the same user within a single day! The first letter to a user is free, 
but each additional letter to the same user that day will cost smorps 🪙

Along with all of that, love letters have gotten a makeover 💄 and include different images based on what was sent. Please note that this change will only be 
visible for *new* love letters - ones that were sent before this update will remain the same. And for *claiming* love letters, the existing command name has been 
updated for clarity 📬

## 🎲 Random Poll changes 🎲
Random polls are now *fully* anonymous and no longer include the "So-and-so asks" message 🙅 Protect your privacy! Polls now also feature a **spicy** button 🥵 to 
allow updating your Danbooru sensitivity without going into the options menu 🌶️ And, if you've ever been curious about the artist/source of a picture, random polls
now link to that information on Danbooru 🔗 *This will also be included for custom polls in a future update* 🎨

## 🔮 What's next? 🔮
That's all for now, Valentine 💘, but the work never ends 👷‍♀️🏗️ The next big release will include a feature I'm *super* excited about, but I'm not ready to share what
it is just yet 🤫 One update I *can* tell you about, though, is that random polls will soon use curated images for general-maturity Danbooru pictures! 
Say goodbye to low quality images! 🥔 Thank you all again for your support, 💞 **Happy Valentine's Day** 💞, and *keep smashing* 😈
