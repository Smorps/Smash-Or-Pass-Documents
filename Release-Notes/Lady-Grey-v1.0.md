# SMORPS Release: Lady Grey ☕
January 13, 2025

Hello, smashers and passers! _This is a momentous release._ Almost 3 years since Smash or Pass was released on January 25, 2022, this is by far the best update yet. 
It truly captures what makes this bot great and sets a clear path for more improvements in the future. Fittingly, I'm choosing this release to ditch our old habit of using version numbers for naming major releases.
From now on, releases will use easy to reference code names - starting with the bright and refreshing **Lady Grey ☕** There's a lot here, so let's get into it!

## What's New?
### Smash Menu 🍽️
_The age of typing is over - the age of clicking is here._ 

The Smash Menu is a hub for most of the bot's features which can be accessed with a click of a button rather than typing out a / command. Buttons on the menu include:

* 🔥 SMASH OR PASS (YOU): Start a smash or pass poll with yourself as the subject - replaces the old /smash command
* ✏️ SMASH OR PASS (CUSTOM): Create your own smash or pass poll with a custom name, prompt, and image - replaces the old /custom_smash command
* 🎲 SMASH OR PASS (RANDOM): Start a smash or pass poll with a random character from Danbooru - replaces the old /random command
* 💰 PATREON: Provides an easy link to the bot's Patreon page
* 🎟️ SERVER PASS & SUPER SERVER PASS: Link to the bot's storefront on Discord
* ⚙️ OPTIONS: Allows users to configure certain aspects of the bot's behavior

Also included is functionality that was previously only available using /profile and /scorecard - which were premium features.

The Smash Menu can be accessed by using **/smash** and effectively rolls up a number of / commands into one. Consequently, the /smash, /custom_smash, /random, /profile, and /scorecard commands have been retired.
Thank you for your service 🫡

### Server Passes 🎟️
Did you catch this in the last section? The bot now offers server-level subscriptions directly through Discord! On offer are the Server Pass and Super Server Pass. Either pass unlocks premium features for your
entire server rather than just for a single member. Be a hero and let everyone in on the fun! 🎉

### Options ⚙️
Yep, there was another feature introduced in the Smash Menu - Options! A lot of you have asked for this over the years, so I'm happy it's finally here. The Options button will also be available on all polls. 
This feature is still being built out, but for now it includes
the following fields you can toggle:
* Include prompts (Yes/No) - allows you to set whether your polls will have prompts or not
* Active search engine (danbooru/google) - allows you to select your search engine for image results. Please note that images will only be returned from google if you have premium membership.

While there are only two options for now, and they're options you already had, this is just the start! Additional options are on the way 🚚

### Custom Smash Prompts ✏️
Speaking of prompts, did you notice this one in the Smash Menu description? Users may now set their own custom prompts! Do you have a really specific joke you want to see in a poll? PRESTO - now you can! Want to 
include something there's 0-chance I'd ever write? BOOM - you may do as you please. Custom smash polls are also filled out using a modal menu now rather than the old text input menu.

### Repeat Buttons 🔁
This one actually got partially released on the down low recently, but here's the official announcement! All polls now include a button that will allow you to send the same type of poll _again_, and _again_, 
and _again_, and _again_, and _again_, and _again_, and _again_

### Other Updates ⭐
* Consolidated users into a single profile in the bot's DB. This required a consolidation of user points and credits as well, so users' point and credit values were updated to the maximum value found across their
  profiles. This also means users will have the same point/credit value across all of their servers.
* Lots of little text and design changes to make the bot as clear as possible
* Resolved a common error that prevented the bot from working when added to a new server

## The future 🚀
As I've mentioned, one of the best things about this update is that it lays the groundwork for even more great updates in the future! This is largely due to the support of two of my friends, who recently stepped in
to help me with development, as well as the support from all of you! Thank you for sticking with me if you've been here for a while, and thank you for checking the bot out if you're new. I'm looking forward to
releasing the next updates that are in the works, and, as always, keep smashing 😈
