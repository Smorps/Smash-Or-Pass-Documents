## Quick Release Notes 🏃🏻‍♂️‍➡️ 
Hi, everyone! Apologies for the radio silence :pray:  I needed some time to recharge after the flurry of updates in the beginning of the year :sleeping: Here's what's new!

## Curated General Images 🖼️
While I've been asleep, the Smash or Pass labor force has been rating images for sensitive and general random polls :factory_worker: That means no more low-quality images for your general-maturity random polls! :tada: I hope you enjoy!

## Back to sleep? 🛌🏻
That's all for now - I hope to be back at 100% in the near future :fingers_crossed: Until then, please feel free to reach out for any support needs or with suggestions! Thank you for enjoying the bot, and *keep smashing* :smiling_imp:
